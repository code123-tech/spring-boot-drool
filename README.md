Drools is a Business Rule Management System Engine that is based on Java Rules API. It is very useful in creating complex applications where business logic keeps changing post-development.
For example, you may run a shopping website that provides discounts based on certain criteria. But these criteria may change in the future. In these cases, It would require a code change to update the business logic. However, You can use a rule engine like Drools to externalize the decision logic thus avoiding technical debt.
